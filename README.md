# quacker
A NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY IDEA

## Why

To get rich! Also, as a side effect, to learn endpoint handling. We are going to keep our code modular and get experience routing requests to create a CR-D application.

We want to make an app that's good for publishing short thoughts and seeing other people's. Can't believe no one's thought of it yet.

## What

  + [ ] An app with Create, Read and Delete endpoints

  + [ ] Quax will be persistently available

  + [ ] Some authentication process
    + [ ] Cookies

  + [ ] LIVE on HEROKU! Quack.

  + [ ] Real-time tweet updates


## How

  + [ ] CR-D accessed using HTTP `POST`, `GET` and `DELETE` respectively.

  + Quax will be stored in Redis.
    + [ ] Stored in memory
    + [ ] Stored in file system
    + [ ] Stored in Redis
